When it rains the water
raises the dead
street long enough
to let the wheels
find the divots of neglect.
That is why I walked
barefoot to your lintel:
everything built skews
away from us and toward
the gray light of wealth.
Whether it is cold
or the stucco hot,
I will remind you to be afraid.
I am trying to tell you
neither the road nor the river
can carry the house
